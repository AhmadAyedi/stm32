Overview of the Project
STM32L476RGT3 (Sender): Sends "Hello" via UART and displays it in SWV.
STM32F401RET3 (Receiver): Receives "Hello" via UART and displays it in SWV.
Tools: STM32CubeIDE for both boards.
Connection: UART TX (Sender) to UART RX (Receiver), with a common ground.



Wiring:
Connect PA9 (USART1_TX) on Nucleo-L476RG (CN7 pin 21 or D8) to PA10 (USART1_RX) on Nucleo-F401RE (CN10 pin 33 or D2).
Connect GND from Nucleo-L476RG to GND on Nucleo-F401RE (e.g., CN7 pin 8 to CN10 pin 20).



In Connectivity > USART1:
Set Mode to Asynchronous.
Set Hardware Flow Control to Disabled.
Under Parameter Settings:
Baud Rate: 9600 Bits/s.
Word Length: 8 Bits.
Parity: None.
Stop Bits: 1.
Data Direction: Transmit Only.
Verify PA9 is set to USART1_TX (default on Nucleo-L476RG).
1.3 Configure Clock
Go to Clock Configuration.
Set HCLK to 80 MHz:
Input: HSE 8 MHz (from ST-Link).
PLL: PLL_M = 1, PLL_N = 40, PLL_R = 2.
PCLK2 (USART1 clock) should be 80 MHz.
Resolve any clock issues if prompted.
1.4 Enable SWV
Go to System Core > SYS:
Set Debug to Serial Wire.
Set Timebase Source to SysTick.
Go to System Core > ITM:
Enable ITM Stimulus Port 0.

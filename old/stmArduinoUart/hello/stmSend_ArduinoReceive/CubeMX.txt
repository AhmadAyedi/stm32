Connect PA9 (USART1_TX) on the STM32 Nucleo board (check the pinout, typically on CN7 pin 21 or D8 on Morpho connectors) to Arduino Uno RX (pin 0).
Connect GND from the STM32 Nucleo to GND on the Arduino Uno.


Go to Connectivity > USART1.
Set the Mode to Asynchronous.
Leave Hardware Flow Control as Disabled.

Under Parameter Settings for USART1:
Baud Rate: 9600 Bits/s (common and reliable for Arduino).
Word Length: 8 Bits.
Parity: None.
Stop Bits: 1.
Data Direction: Transmit Only (since weâ€™re only sending from STM32).

1.4 Enable SWV (Serial Wire Viewer) for Debugging
Go to System Core > SYS.
Set Debug to Serial Wire.
Enable Timebase Source as SysTick (default).
Go to System Core > ITM (Instrumentation Trace Macrocell):
Enable ITM Stimulus Port 0 (this is for SWV output).
